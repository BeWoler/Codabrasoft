  title: 'Pulse Plus: Heart Rate Monitor​',
  text: <p className='content__paragraph'>You don’t need any special medical equipment to measure your heart rate and monitor your health, just your phone’s camera! The most accurate, fastest and easiest to use heart rate measurement app.
  <br/><br/>
  The method used:
  <br/><br/>
  Our application is based on photoplethysmography (PPG), a noninvasive optical technique. Each heartbeat sends a certain amount of blood to the tissues in your fingers, while the blood absorbs the light of your camera, it illuminates your skin and allows you to capture microvascular contractions: the inflow and outflow of blood. This allows you to measure your pulse easily, accurately, and efficiently.
  <br/><br/>
  How to use:
  <br/><br/>
  Completely cover the camera lens and flashlight with the tip of your finger. Do not press too hard to avoid blood draining from the limb. Hold the phone steady and do not move. Make sure your fingers are warm. Press the button and get the results.
  <br/><br/>
  Health kit integration:
  <br/><br/>
  Supports sharing heart rate results with the Apple Health App.</p>,
